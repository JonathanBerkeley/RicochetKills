Ricochet Game - Attack of the sprites.
Jonathan's notes:

Notable innovations:
tickrate variable added for timing. It's a variable that increases by one everytime the update scene is ran. This is crucial for timing actions with eachother.
One usage of this is when the game is started, the player is not able to shoot until 41 ticks have passed, this prevents accidental weapon firing.

Dynamic resizing added. To compensate for different screen sizes, dynamic resizing allows the game to be playable in fullscreen on a large variety of screen sizes.
(Sprites and images resize to match screen size, placement for sprites never uses fixed values, instead uses calculations based on screen size.)

Custom font downloaded, converted to multiple different font file formats for compatibility with other browsers.

Added multiple ricochet reflect sound possibilities. Random number generator adds diversity to program.

Bounce collision checking is done independently of arcade physics, checks for value changes in direction of laser object.

Infinite level generation gives a new map every time the player begins a level. 
This generation gives a massive boost to replayability as the map solutions will always be different.
